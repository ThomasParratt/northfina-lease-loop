# Lease Loop · Northfina × Hive Helsinki hackathon

Starter repo for the **Lease Loop** challenge, 5–6 November 2026 at Hive Helsinki. Teams of 3 build a circular-economy leasing app: one e-bike, laptop or tractor, three lives.

- 📋 **The challenge:** [CHALLENGE.md](CHALLENGE.md)
- 📐 **Engineering rules (35 % of your score):** [RULES.md](RULES.md)
- 🗂️ **The data pack:** [data/DATA.md](data/DATA.md)

**Northfina** is a Helsinki-based leasing platform. It started as Etufillari, a bike-leasing service, and now leases any kind of asset. Dealers, banks and customers use it to get from a price quote to a signed contract, then through monthly invoices to the end of the lease. This repo is a small, independent playground, not our product code.

## Quick start

You need **Git** and **Node.js 22** (with [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm): `nvm install` reads `.nvmrc`).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-team>/northfina-lease-loop.git
cd northfina-lease-loop
nvm install          # Node 22
npm ci               # installs dependencies and the Git hooks
npm run db:setup     # creates .env and a local SQLite database with the 30 assets
npm run dev          # http://localhost:3000
```

You should see the asset catalogue in English. Switch to Finnish, Swedish or Estonian in the header.

| Command                 | What it does                                                   |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run setup`         | Set up a checkout or worktree: dependencies, database, hooks   |
| `npm run dev`           | Start the app with hot reload                                  |
| `npm test`              | Run all tests once (`npm run test:watch` to keep them running) |
| `npm run test:coverage` | Tests with the 60 % coverage gate                              |
| `npm run check:all`     | **Everything CI runs.** Run it before you push                 |
| `npm run db:migrate`    | After you change `prisma/schema.prisma`: creates a migration   |
| `npm run db:reset`      | Wipe the local database and seed it again                      |
| `npm run db:studio`     | Browse the database in your browser                            |

## 15-minute tour

New to TypeScript, Next.js or Prisma? Read these files in this order:

1. **`data/`**: the synthetic data pack. Open `assets.json` and `coefficient-table.json`, then the worked example in [DATA.md](data/DATA.md).
2. **`src/data/`**: Zod schemas that load and type-check every data file. If you want to know a field's type, look here.
3. **`src/domain/coefficient.ts`** and its test: a pure function that finds the pricing factor, and how we test it. **Your business logic goes in `src/domain/`**, written the same way.
4. **`src/domain/price-list.ts`**: picks the right price for a date. The price list changes on Friday.
5. **`src/app/[locale]/page.tsx`**: the catalogue page. Next.js App Router: every folder under `src/app/` is a URL.
6. **`src/app/api/assets/`**: API routes. They use the response envelope (`src/server/api-response.ts`), and the status change writes an audit row in the same transaction (`src/server/audit.ts`).
7. **`prisma/schema.prisma`**: the database. Add your own models (Contract, Invoice, …) and run `npm run db:migrate`.

Handy docs: [Next.js App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app), [TypeScript for programmers who know C](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html), [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/docs), [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/guide/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs).

Everything in the skeleton is replaceable. Keep the rules, not necessarily the code.

## Status

Kept by each wave's hardening agent (AGENTS.md rule 9); the draft of the submission PR's "Scenario cards that work" and "Smart Problems" sections. Every card runs as a table-driven test on the real data pack in [`src/domain/scenarios/`](src/domain/scenarios/) (`npx vitest run src/domain/scenarios`); a todo there names a pinned number still to build.

| 10 Third life      | `ebike-008` after 2 lives, good, 9 800 km: the passport with both lives and the pro-rata CO₂ (58 kg after a 24-month third life)                                                                             | partly: the passport and the CO₂ are built; the lease-again page is wave 3             | `card-10-third-life.test.ts`; `co2.test.ts` and `asset-events.test.ts` "card 10"                                                                  |

The card files are in `src/domain/scenarios/`; the others sit next to the code they test.

**Traps** (`src/domain/scenarios/traps.test.ts`): the inclusive band edge (`laptop-002` at 199 999 is A, `laptop-003` at 200 000 is B; on v1 only, v2 prices both at 184 000); `ebike-010` below the table on v1 (inside band A on v2) and `farm-006` above it, each a code; the broken business ID; both twin pairs told apart in the data (the matcher's tie-break is a wave 3 todo); invoices on 31 Dec 2026 at 25.5 % and on 1 Jan 2027 at 26 %; 29 Feb 2028 due dates; the price list in force on 5 and 6 Nov. The reserved `ebike-009` is refused where its status is read: `src/server/quotes.test.ts` "refuses a reserved asset (ebike-009) with its status". Every customer × one asset per category decides with a known code: `src/domain/scenarios/customers.test.ts`.

**Finding, fixed:** the quote’s totals used to add the down payment and the buyout net while invoice 0 charges VAT on the down payment (card 7: 510 000 short). The pricing slice fixed it on `main` (`4ec3b2e`); `src/domain/scenarios/quote-schedule.property.test.ts` now proves that the quote total equals what the invoices add up to whenever one VAT rate covers the term, and "card 7: invoice 0 is the quote down payment with its VAT".

**Smart problems** (order from `docs/kickoff-brief.md` section 4):

- 4 The smart question flow: done ([docs/features/question-flow.md](docs/features/question-flow.md)).
- 7 Circular impact: partly; the method, the passport and the fleet counter are done, the third-life lease page is wave 3 ([docs/features/circular-impact.md](docs/features/circular-impact.md)).
- 1 Lock the price, not the tax: done; the quote freezes the list version and the net rent, and each invoice takes the VAT of its own date ([docs/features/pricing.md](docs/features/pricing.md), [docs/features/invoicing.md](docs/features/invoicing.md)).
- 5 Money that adds up: done for the schedule and the balance (property tests in `src/domain/invoicing/schedule.property.test.ts` and `src/domain/scenarios/quote-schedule.property.test.ts`) ([docs/features/invoicing.md](docs/features/invoicing.md)).
- 6 Explain my price: done; the breakdown line by line and the term comparison ([docs/features/pricing.md](docs/features/pricing.md)).
- 2 Fair early exit: not yet (wave 2); the D14 balance it rests on is built.
- 3 Second-life matchmaking: not yet (wave 3).

## Submitting

You can't push to this repo. You work in **your own fork** and send us a **pull request**.

1. **One person per team forks** this repo (the **Fork** button, top right) and adds the other two as collaborators in the fork (_Settings → Collaborators_).
2. **Enable Actions in the fork**: open the fork's **Actions** tab and click _"I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them"_. Now CI runs on every push.
3. Everyone clones the fork and commits as usual. Small, conventional commits; the hooks help.
4. **Before Friday 6 November 16:00**, open a pull request from your fork to `etufillari/northfina-lease-loop` `main`.
   - Title: `Team <name>: <your product name>`.
   - Fill in the template: members, the Smart Problems you picked, and how to demo.
   - You can open it early and keep pushing until the deadline.
5. **At 16:00 we record the latest commit of every open pull request.** That commit is what we judge. Anything pushed later is ignored, and pull requests opened after 16:00 don't count.

We won't merge pull requests. They're only how you hand in your work.

**Heads-up:** forks of a public repo are public, so other teams can see your fork. Your commit history shows who built what, and copying another team's work disqualifies both copies.
