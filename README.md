# Lease Loop · Northfina × Hive Helsinki hackathon

Starter repo for the **Lease Loop** challenge, 5–6 November 2026 at Hive Helsinki. Teams of 3 build a circular-economy leasing app: one e-bike, laptop or tractor, three lives.

- 📋 **The challenge:** [CHALLENGE.md](CHALLENGE.md)
- 📐 **Engineering rules (35 % of your score):** [RULES.md](RULES.md)
- 🗂️ **The data pack:** [data/DATA.md](data/DATA.md)

**Northfina** is a Helsinki-based leasing platform. It started as Etufillari, a bike-leasing service, and now leases any kind of asset. Dealers, banks and customers use it to get from a price quote to a signed contract, then through monthly invoices to the end of the lease. This repo is a small, independent playground, not our product code.

## Quick start

You need **Git** and **Node.js 22** (with [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm): `nvm install` reads `.nvmrc`).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-team>/northfina-lease-loop.git
cd northfina-lease-loop
nvm install          # Node 22
npm ci               # installs dependencies and the Git hooks
npm run db:setup     # creates .env and a local SQLite database with the 30 assets
npm run dev          # http://localhost:3000
```

You should see the asset catalogue in English. Switch to Finnish, Swedish or Estonian in the header.

| Command                 | What it does                                                   |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run setup`         | Set up a checkout or worktree: dependencies, database, hooks   |
| `npm run dev`           | Start the app with hot reload                                  |
| `npm test`              | Run all tests once (`npm run test:watch` to keep them running) |
| `npm run test:coverage` | Tests with the 60 % coverage gate                              |
| `npm run check:all`     | **Everything CI runs.** Run it before you push                 |
| `npm run db:migrate`    | After you change `prisma/schema.prisma`: creates a migration   |
| `npm run db:reset`      | Wipe the local database and seed it again                      |
| `npm run db:studio`     | Browse the database in your browser                            |

## 15-minute tour

New to TypeScript, Next.js or Prisma? Read these files in this order:

1. **`data/`**: the synthetic data pack. Open `assets.json` and `coefficient-table.json`, then the worked example in [DATA.md](data/DATA.md).
2. **`src/data/`**: Zod schemas that load and type-check every data file. If you want to know a field's type, look here.
3. **`src/domain/coefficient.ts`** and its test: a pure function that finds the pricing factor, and how we test it. **Your business logic goes in `src/domain/`**, written the same way.
4. **`src/domain/price-list.ts`**: picks the right price for a date. The price list changes on Friday.
5. **`src/app/[locale]/page.tsx`**: the catalogue page. Next.js App Router: every folder under `src/app/` is a URL.
6. **`src/app/api/assets/`**: API routes. They use the response envelope (`src/server/api-response.ts`), and the status change writes an audit row in the same transaction (`src/server/audit.ts`).
7. **`prisma/schema.prisma`**: the database. Add your own models (Contract, Invoice, …) and run `npm run db:migrate`.

Handy docs: [Next.js App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app), [TypeScript for programmers who know C](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html), [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/docs), [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/guide/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs).

Everything in the skeleton is replaceable. Keep the rules, not necessarily the code.

## Status

Kept by each wave's hardening agent (AGENTS.md rule 9); the draft of the submission PR's "Scenario cards that work" and "Smart Problems" sections. Every card runs twice: as a table-driven test on the real data pack in [`src/domain/scenarios/`](src/domain/scenarios/) (pure, `npx vitest run src/domain/scenarios`), and end to end in [`src/server/scenarios/`](src/server/scenarios/) on a real migrated database through the services the routes call: quote, the question flow, the decision, signing, payments, the exit, the passport and the audit chain (`npx vitest run src/server/scenarios`). A todo names a pinned number still to build. How the tests stay independent: [docs/features/test-isolation.md](docs/features/test-isolation.md).

| 10 Third life      | `ebike-008` after 2 lives, good, 9 800 km: the passport with both lives and the pro-rata CO₂ (58 kg after a 24-month third life)                                                                             | partly: the passport and the CO₂ are built and read from the database; leasing it again is wave 3 (the pack has it `returned`, a quote needs `available`) | `card-10-third-life.test.ts`; `src/server/scenarios/card-10.test.ts` (the seeded passport, the refused quote, a return writing a counted life; 1 todo); `co2.test.ts` and `asset-events.test.ts` "card 10" |

The pure card files are in `src/domain/scenarios/`, the end-to-end ones in `src/server/scenarios/`; the others sit next to the code they test.

**Traps** (`src/domain/scenarios/traps.test.ts`): the inclusive band edge (`laptop-002` at 199 999 is A, `laptop-003` at 200 000 is B; on v1 only, v2 prices both at 184 000); `ebike-010` below the table on v1 (inside band A on v2) and `farm-006` above it, each a code; the broken business ID; both twin pairs told apart in the data (the matcher's tie-break is a wave 3 todo); invoices on 31 Dec 2026 at 25.5 % and on 1 Jan 2027 at 26 %; 29 Feb 2028 due dates; the price list in force on 5 and 6 Nov. The reserved `ebike-009` is refused where its status is read: `src/server/quotes.test.ts` "refuses a reserved asset (ebike-009) with its status". Every customer × one asset per category decides with a known code: `src/domain/scenarios/customers.test.ts`.

**Finding, fixed:** the quote’s totals used to add the down payment and the buyout net while invoice 0 charges VAT on the down payment (card 7: 510 000 short). The pricing slice fixed it on `main` (`4ec3b2e`); `src/domain/scenarios/quote-schedule.property.test.ts` now proves that the quote total equals what the invoices add up to whenever one VAT rate covers the term, and "card 7: invoice 0 is the quote down payment with its VAT".

**Smart problems** (order from `docs/kickoff-brief.md` section 4):

- 4 The smart question flow: done ([docs/features/question-flow.md](docs/features/question-flow.md)).
- 7 Circular impact: done for the method, the passport, the fleet counter and the passport after a return; the third-life lease is wave 3 ([docs/features/circular-impact.md](docs/features/circular-impact.md)).
- 1 Lock the price, not the tax: done; the quote freezes the list version and the net rent, and each invoice takes the VAT of its own date ([docs/features/pricing.md](docs/features/pricing.md), [docs/features/invoicing.md](docs/features/invoicing.md)).
- 5 Money that adds up: done for the schedule and the balance (property tests in `src/domain/invoicing/schedule.property.test.ts` and `src/domain/scenarios/quote-schedule.property.test.ts`) ([docs/features/invoicing.md](docs/features/invoicing.md)).
- 6 Explain my price: done; the breakdown line by line and the term comparison ([docs/features/pricing.md](docs/features/pricing.md)).
- 2 Fair early exit: done, provisional on D31; buy, return and pass on line by line, the unpaid rents cancelled, one final invoice with the VAT of its day ([docs/features/exits.md](docs/features/exits.md)).
- 3 Second-life matchmaking: not yet (wave 3); the refurbishment plan it rests on is built.

## Features

Per-feature state (missing, in progress, done, verified): [docs/features/STATUS.md](docs/features/STATUS.md).

One page per feature slice under `docs/features/` (template: [docs/features/README.md](docs/features/README.md)):

- [Catalogue, demo clock, actor and audit trail](docs/features/catalogue.md) (wave 0)
- [Circular impact and the passport](docs/features/circular-impact.md) (wave 1)
- [Pricing and quotes](docs/features/pricing.md) (wave 1): the price page with live sliders, the line-by-line breakdown, the term comparison, the catalogue's offer (`financeOffer`) and "Apply at this price", which locks the quote at its date and list version (cards 1, 2, 6, 7; smart problem 6); the maximum term per item category (D43: a laptop up to 36 months, from `data/term-limits.json`)
- [The question flow and the application](docs/features/question-flow.md) (wave 1)
- [Invoicing: the schedule, VAT by invoice date, the balance](docs/features/invoicing.md) (wave 1): the monthly schedule billed in advance, paying an invoice, the outstanding balance for an early exit
- [Contracts: signing and the contract page](docs/features/contracts.md) (wave 2): the Sign form on the approved application page, signing an approved application from its stored quote, the last-unit race, the price lock explained (cards 1, 2) and the invoices under the contract (card 3)
- [Row schemas](docs/features/row-schemas.md): the Zod rules every stored row is parsed with before the write, held to `prisma/schema.prisma` by a test (D27)
- [Exits: buy out, return, pass on and the early exit](docs/features/exits.md) (wave 2): the D14 early exit line by line, the market value by the residual curve, the refurbishment plan, the contract page section (card 8; the exits cards 9 and 10 start from)
- [The look: tokens, the price tag, life stamps and drawings](docs/features/look.md): one warm look for every page through colour roles, the price tag, the life stamp and a drawing per kind of item; the demo tools in their own strip above the customer header (D21)
- [The tamper-evident audit chain](docs/features/audit-chain.md) (wave 2): every audit row hash-chained to the one before it in the same transaction, the verifier, the chain badge with the head hash and the `demo:tamper` script

## Team notes

- `AGENTS.md`: the organiser's rules plus our working rules; every agent and person reads it first.
- `docs/kickoff-brief.md`: the plan (scope, decisions, schema ownership, events, waves, the agent brief template).
- `docs/decisions.md`: every decision with its reason; `docs/stack-notes.md`: the traps of this stack; `docs/log/`: one time log per task; `docs/reviews/`: the wave reviews.
- `tests/meta-rules.test.ts`: the engineering rules checked against the repository itself, in `npm test`.
- The practice repo (`ThomasParratt/leasing-platform`) is a read-only parts bin cloned beside this one; port functions with their tests, never structure.
- A branch is named after the feature it builds, `<type>/<slice>` with the conventional-commit type as prefix: `feat/pricing`, `feat/invoices`, `chore/wave0-upkeep`, `test/wave1-hardening`; a session that starts on a generated name renames it with `git branch -m` before its first push.
- Nobody pushes to `main` directly, not even docs or tooling: every change is a branch and a pull request on the fork, CI runs on the PR, and it is squash-merged with a conventional subject.

### Database

SQLite through Prisma 7, schema in `prisma/schema.prisma`, `snake_case` columns. Models: `Asset` and `Customer` (both seeded from the data pack by `npm run db:setup`, idempotently), `Quote`, `Application`, `Contract`, `Invoice`, `AssetEvent` (the passport; its autoincrement id is the order), `ReturnAssessment` and `AuditLog`. Who owns and writes each model is `docs/kickoff-brief.md` section 6. Money is integer cents, rent factors integer millionths, VAT rates basis points, business dates ISO day strings. SQLite has no enums: the asset values are Zod enums in `src/data/schemas.ts`, and the allowed decisions, contract and invoice statuses, invoice kinds and event kinds in `src/domain/statuses.ts`. The server function that writes a value parses it with its schema itself, before the write (D23), so a caller that skips the route cannot store a bad one. An asset is `available`, `reserved` (held, the data pack's meaning), `leased` (on a contract), `returned` or `sold` (bought out) (D22). Customers are read through `listCustomers` / `getCustomer` in `src/server/customers.ts`, in the `Customer` shape of `src/data/schemas.ts`.

### Who is acting

There is no login (D17). The "continue as" picker (`src/components/actor-picker.tsx`, in the header) posts `{ actor }` (a customer id or `admin`) to `POST /api/actor`, which sets the `lease-loop-actor` cookie; `DELETE /api/actor` clears it. Pages and routes call `readActor(db)` from `src/server/actor.ts` once per request and pass the actor to `withAudit`; an unknown or missing cookie reads as `anonymous`.

### API

Every API route has one row in the route table, `src/server/routes.ts`: method, the Next.js path pattern (`/api/assets/[id]/status`), a summary, a tag, and the Zod schemas of its params, query, body and success `data`. Route files import their schemas from there. `npm run openapi` turns the table into [docs/openapi.json](docs/openapi.json) (OpenAPI 3.1, success bodies wrapped in the `ok()` envelope, errors in the `fail()` one). Tests fail when a `route.ts` has no row (or a row no file) and when the committed `docs/openapi.json` differs from the table, so add the row first and run `npm run openapi` after.

### Events

When one change touches several slices' rows at one instant, the owner emits one event inside `withAudit` and the other slices react in the same transaction (`docs/kickoff-brief.md` section 7). The payloads are Zod schemas in `src/domain/events.ts`: `CONTRACT_SIGNED`, `CONTRACT_BOUGHT_OUT`, `UNIT_RETURNED`, `UNIT_PASSED_ON`, `INVOICE_PAID`. `src/server/events.ts` has `onEvent(type, handler)` and `emit(tx, event)`: handlers get the same `tx`, run in registration order, and a handler that throws rolls the whole change back.

### Pages

`/[locale]` is the landing page, `/[locale]/catalogue` the catalogue (what can be leased today, one card per model; filtered by `?category=`, then `?condition=`, `?brand=` and `?sort=`, D42), `/[locale]/demo` the demo page (the clock and, from wave 1, one button per scenario card), `/[locale]/audit` the newest 50 audit rows, `/[locale]/assets/[id]` the price page and the stored quote, `/[locale]/assets/[id]/passport` the passport, `/[locale]/apply/[quoteId]` the application and `/[locale]/applications/[id]` its decision. The page header is split in two (`src/components/site-header.tsx`): a teal staff strip with the demo tools (the "continue as" actor picker, the demo page, and the audit log for admin only), and the customer header with the catalogue, how it works and the language switcher, folding into a menu on a phone. The layout reads the customers and the current actor once per request for the picker. Pages are built from the kit in `src/components/ui` (`PageHeader`, `Card`, `Button`, `LinkButton`, `Badge`, `DefinitionList`, `Field`, `Notice`, `Money`, `DateText`, `NavLinks`, `PriceTag`, `LifeStamp`, `StaffNote`, one `index.ts`), `ItemArt` for the drawings, and the tokens in `src/app/globals.css` (D21, [docs/features/look.md](docs/features/look.md)): pages use the roles `brand`, `brand-soft`, `accent`, `focus`, `success`, `warning`, `danger`, `info`, `neutral`, `staff`, `surface`, `raised`, `muted`, `line`, `line-strong`, `ink`, `ink-muted` (e.g. `bg-brand`, `text-ink-muted`, `bg-success-soft`), never raw colour classes or the scales under them. Each token switches with the colour scheme, so no page needs a `dark:` class.

### Demo clock

The demo page moves the app to any day, so a scenario card dated September 2026 or February 2028 runs on its own date. `POST /api/demo/clock` with `{ "asOf": "2026-09-15" }` sets the `lease-loop-as-of` cookie and `{ "asOf": null }` clears it. Pages and routes call `todayForRequest()` from `src/server/demo-clock.ts` once and pass the day down; it is `todayIso()` unless the cookie holds a real calendar day (an invalid one is ignored). The catalogue's "prices on" follows it. It is the only date the server takes from the browser.

### Pricing and quotes

`/[locale]/assets/[id]` (linked from every catalogue card; an item that needs a down payment or several units to fit the bands opens set up that way, with a notice saying why, D41) has two sliders (the term over the terms the item may be offered, the table's 12/24/36/48 under its category's cap (D43) and the down payment, 0 to the price in 1 % steps) and a quantity field, beside the item from 768 px. Each change asks `GET /api/quotes/preview`, which prices on the request's day and returns the breakdown (list price, × quantity, down payment, financed amount, band and factor, net rent, VAT and gross, per-unit split, buyout, total if you return it and if you buy it) and every term side by side; the browser never computes a price. "Apply at this price" posts to `POST /api/quotes`, which stores a `Quote` row through `withAudit` (`quote.created`), valid 14 days, and opens `/[locale]/apply/[quoteId]`, which shows "Price locked until" while the quote is valid. The breakdown and the term comparison are collapsible sections under the price panel. `GET /api/quotes/[id]` rebuilds the breakdown from the stored numbers and never re-prices. The pure functions are in `src/domain/pricing/` (`priceQuote`, `compareTerms`, `financeOffer`, `quoteStatusOn`, `breakdownFromFrozen`, `addDays`); refusals (`below_minimum`, `above_maximum`, `down_payment_too_high`, …) are codes with params written from `pricing.refusal.*`. Full description, the worked examples and the decisions: [docs/features/pricing.md](docs/features/pricing.md).

### Application

The question flow (CHALLENGE.md smart problem 4) is pure code in `src/domain/question-flow/`:

- `engine.ts`: `visibleQuestions(bank, context, answers)` applies `ask_when` as `data/DATA.md` says (all conditions; empty = always; `in`, `gte`, `lte`; `answers.<id>`), in the bank's order. `customer_type` is the applicant's own `q_customer_type` answer once given, the context's before. `nextQuestion` is the first visible question without an answer; `pruneAnswers` drops answers to questions that are no longer visible, repeating until stable (can-sign no → signatory named → yes: the signatory goes). `whyWeAsk(question, locale)` falls back to English. The context is `{ customerType, category, financedCents, termMonths }`, built by the caller from the quote.
- `eligibility.ts`: `evaluate(rules, input)` → `{ decision, reasons: { code, params }[] }` (D9). Any failed rule rejects and every failure is listed (`too_young` with `eighteenOn`, `residency_not_allowed`, `unaffordable` at 30 % of net income against the gross rent, `invalid_business_id`, `financed_out_of_range`, `missing_answer`); else a PEP goes to `manual_review`; else a company applicant who cannot sign is `awaiting_signatory`; else `approved` with `all_checks_passed`. Affordability applies only when the bank asked for income (consumers from 200 000 financed). A 29 February birthday turns 18 on 1 March.
- `business-id.ts`: the Y-tunnus check digit (weights 7 9 10 5 8 4 2, mod 11; remainder 1 is never valid). `answers.ts`: the answers → eligibility input, answer validation by type, euros typed by a person → cents without floats, gross = net + VAT through the shared `splitVat` of `src/domain/money-math.ts` (D1), and `answersFromCustomer` for the demo prefill.

`src/server/applications.ts` has `createApplication` (reads the quote through pricing's `getQuote` and the customer through `getCustomer`, prunes, refuses incomplete or malformed answers and an expired quote, evaluates, writes the row through `withAudit`), `decideApplication` (D10: an admin decides a manual review, and one that also needs a signatory then waits for them; the named signatory signs or declines; anything else is final) and `getApplication`. Routes: `POST /api/applications`, `GET /api/applications/[id]`, `POST /api/applications/[id]/decision`. Pages: `/[locale]/apply/[quoteId]` asks one question at a time for the acting customer, with "why we ask", back, progress, a review with "change" per answer and a notice when a change removes answers; `/[locale]/applications/[id]` writes the decision and each reason from `decision.reason.<code>` in the visitor's language, with the admin's review buttons, the signatory's sign form, or on a yes the Sign form that turns it into a contract. The rules worked through cards 5, 6 and 7, the signatures and the open questions: [docs/features/question-flow.md](docs/features/question-flow.md).

### Invoices

At signing, the `CONTRACT_SIGNED` handler (`src/server/invoice-handlers.ts`, registered through `src/server/event-handlers.ts`) builds the schedule with `buildSchedule` from `src/domain/invoicing` and writes it in the signing transaction. Invoice 0 is the down payment, issued on the signing day and left out when the down payment is zero. Invoices 1 to term are each one full month of rent, issued and due on the first day of the period, with the start day clamped to short months. Each invoice takes the VAT rate in force on its issue date (D2–D5). `GET /api/invoices?contractId=` lists a contract's invoices. `POST /api/invoices/[id]/pay` pays one on the request's day, writes the audit row and emits `INVOICE_PAID`. Both routes are open to the contract's customer and admin only. `<InvoiceTable contractId today locale t />` (`src/components/invoice-table.tsx`) is the table for the contract page, with one line explaining a VAT change. `outstandingBalanceAfter` gives the D14 balance after n rents, row by row, for the early exit. Anything that emits an event imports `@/server/event-handlers` first.

### Passport and impact

Every lease, return, buyout and pass-on writes a row to the asset event log (`AssetEvent`, ordered by id) through the handlers in `src/server/passport-handlers.ts`, registered by `src/server/event-handlers.ts` (a service that emits imports that module). `src/domain/passport.ts` folds the log into lives (`livesFromEvents`, `passportFor`; the lives `previous_lives` counts come first, undated, 24 months assumed). `src/domain/second-life/co2.ts` is the CO2 method of D15: a later life avoids footprint × (1 − refurbishment share) × its months ÷ the design life, capped at the design life that is left; the first life earns nothing; grams rounded once to whole kg. `GET /api/assets/[id]/passport` returns the asset, its lives and the CO2; the page is `/[locale]/assets/[id]/passport`, and the catalogue shows the fleet total in the impact strip. Card 10: `ebike-008` has saved 29 kg from its second life and reaches 58 kg after a 24-month third life. The method, worked example and open questions: [docs/features/circular-impact.md](docs/features/circular-impact.md).
