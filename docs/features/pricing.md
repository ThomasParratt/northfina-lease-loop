# Pricing and quotes

Spine steps 1 and 2 of `CHALLENGE.md`, smart problem 6 ("Explain my price") and scenario cards 1, 2, 6 and 7.

## What it does

The price page shows what an item costs a month for any term, down payment and quantity, line by line from the list price to the total cost, and compares the four terms side by side. "Get a quote" freezes that price for 14 days at its date and price-list version, so a later price list never changes it.

In detail:

- **The price page** `/[locale]/assets/[id]`: the asset, a term slider (12/24/36/48 months), a down-payment slider (0 to the price, in steps of 1 % of the price rounded to whole euros) and a quantity field (1–20). The monthly price updates live from `GET /api/quotes/preview`; the browser never computes a price.
- **The breakdown**, as a definition list in plain words: price of the item (and of N items), what you pay at the start, the amount we finance, the band and factor, the monthly rent without VAT, the VAT and what you pay each month, the per-item share for a fleet, the buyout at the end, and the total cost two ways (if you give it back, if you keep it).
- **The term comparison**: the same choices priced at every term, side by side, with the terms that cannot be priced and why.
- **The stored quote** (D7): "Get a quote" stores a `Quote` row priced on the request's day, valid 14 days, with an audit row. `?quote=<id>` on the price page shows it locked at its date and price-list version, with its validity, a notice when a cheaper list is live today (card 2) and the link to the application (`/[locale]/apply/[quoteId]`, the question-flow slice's page).
- **Refusals are codes with params** (rule 6): `invalid_quantity`, `invalid_down_payment`, `unknown_term`, `unknown_asset`, `no_price_list_on_date`, `down_payment_too_high`, `below_minimum`, `above_maximum`, `no_vat_rate_on_date`, and from the stored quote `asset_not_available`. The page writes them from `pricing.refusal.*` in the visitor's language, with amounts formatted as euros.

## The rule

```text
list price       = net list price of one unit on the day × quantity          (price list in force that day)
financed         = list price − down payment                                  (D8; down payment < list price)
band, factor     = coefficient table row for the financed amount, column for the term
monthly net      = financed × factorMillionths / 1 000 000, rounded half up   (D1, applyMillionths)
monthly VAT      = monthly net × rate in basis points / 10 000, half up        (D1, rounded from the net, per line)
monthly gross    = monthly net + monthly VAT
buyout           = financed × buyout % of the term, half up                     (15 % at 36 months)
total if return  = down payment + term × monthly gross                          (D6)
total if buy     = total if return + buyout                                     (D6)
```

The VAT in the totals is the quote day's rate and is labelled an estimate: VAT is charged at each invoice's date (D2), so the fictional 26 % from 1 Jan 2027 moves the later rents of a lease that crosses it. The down payment and the buyout are shown VAT excluded, as the data pack gives them.

### Card 1, line by line (`ebike-003`, 36 months, no down payment, 5 Nov 2026)

| Line                   | Number                                          |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| List price (v1)        | 389 000                                         |
| Financed               | 389 000 − 0 = 389 000 → band B                  |
| Factor (B, 36)         | 0.027584 → 27 584 millionths                    |
| Monthly net            | 389 000 × 27 584 / 10⁶ = 10 730.18 → **10 730** |
| VAT 25.5 %             | 10 730 × 2550 / 10⁴ = 2 736.15 → **2 736**      |
| Monthly gross          | **13 466**                                      |
| Buyout (15 %)          | **58 350**                                      |
| Total if you return it | 36 × 13 466 = **484 776**                       |
| Total if you buy it    | 484 776 + 58 350 = **543 126**                  |

### Card 6, four bikes (`ebike-004`, 36 months)

One `ebike-004` is 549 000: band B, 549 000 × 0.027584 = 15 143.6 → **15 144** a month. Four are financed as one amount (D8): 4 × 549 000 = **2 196 000**, which crosses the band C floor (1 000 000), so the factor drops to 0.026864 and the rent for the four is 2 196 000 × 0.026864 = 58 993.3 → **58 993** (14 748.25 a bike, against 15 144 alone). The per-unit split never loses a cent: 58 993 = 4 × 14 748 + 1, and the breakdown says one item carries the extra cent.

### Card 7, the half cent (`farm-002`, 48 months, 2 000 000 down)

14 500 000 − 2 000 000 = **12 500 000** financed, band D, factor 0.021763: 12 500 000 × 21 763 = 272 037 500 000, / 10⁶ = **272 037.5** exactly. Half up gives **272 038**. Floating-point euros would get this wrong; the integer division with a remainder test cannot. Buyout 8 % = **1 000 000**.

### Card 2, the locked price (`laptop-004`, band B, 36 months)

On 5 Nov 2026 list v1 is 349 000 → 9 627 a month. On 6 Nov list v2 is 321 100 → 8 857. A quote made on 5 Nov and opened on 6 Nov still shows 9 627, list v1 and its date: the stored numbers are frozen and `getQuote` rebuilds the breakdown from them without re-pricing. `quoteStatusOn` sees that v2 is live and cheaper and the page says so, with a link to price it again today.

## Decisions

- **D1** rounding: half up to the cent, once, after integer arithmetic (`applyMillionths`, `percentOf`). Implemented as proposed.
- **D6** total cost: two totals, "if you return it" and "if you buy it". Implemented as proposed.
- **D7** the quote: a stored record with date, list version, band, factor, rent, buyout and the VAT rate at quote, valid 14 days (`valid_until = quote_date + 14`, that day included). Implemented as proposed.
- **D8** quantity: financed = list × quantity − down, band on the total, one quote, per-unit split. Implemented; the mentor question stays open.
- Not in the decisions file yet, chosen here: the per-unit split puts the leftover cents on the first units (`splitEvenly`) instead of rounding each share; an asset that is not `available` (the reserved `ebike-009`) shows its price but cannot be quoted (`asset_not_available`).

## Pure functions (`src/domain/pricing/`)

```ts
priceQuote(data: PricingData, input: QuoteInput): QuoteResult
  // PricingData = { priceLists, table, vatRates }
  // QuoteInput = { assetId, quantity, termMonths, downPaymentCents, isoDate }
  // QuoteResult = { ok: true; quote: QuoteBreakdown } | { ok: false; reason: QuoteRefusal }
breakdownFromFrozen(frozen: FrozenQuote): QuoteBreakdown   // the stored numbers → every derived line
compareTerms(data: PricingData, input: Omit<QuoteInput, 'termMonths'>): TermComparison
quoteStatusOn(quote: QuoteForStatus, today: string, priceLists): QuoteStatus
termsOf(table): number[]
splitEvenly(totalCents: number, parts: number): UnitSplit
addDays(isoDay: string, days: number): string
QUOTE_VALID_DAYS = 14
```

Server (`src/server/quotes.ts`): `loadPricingData()`, `createQuote(db, { assetId, quantity, termMonths, downPaymentCents, today, actor }, data?)`, `getQuote(db, id)`, `storedQuoteStatusOn(stored, today, priceLists)`, `previewQuote(data, { …, today })`.

## Open questions

- **D8, for the mentors:** is "4 ×" in card 6 meant as one financed amount (band C, our reading) or four separate leases (band B each)? Every asset in the pack is one serialised unit and there is one `ebike-004`; this slice prices the fleet and does not assign units (that is the contract's job).
- Should the totals add VAT to the down payment and the buyout for a consumer? The data pack gives both net; we show them net and say so.
- The quote shows the totals at the quote-day VAT rate. A lease that crosses 1 Jan 2027 will invoice later months at 26 %; the invoicing slice owns that, and the quote's note says the totals are an estimate.
