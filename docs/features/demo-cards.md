# Demo cards: one button per scenario card

## What it does

The demo page (`/[locale]/demo`) has a Run button for each of the ten scenario cards of `CHALLENGE.md` section 4: it runs the card through the same services the routes call, each step on the card's own day and as the card's customer, then sets the demo clock and the actor and links the page where the judges compare the numbers. The page is also the one entry point to the demo tools (issue #35): the clock, the cards, and the audit log with its chain badge and the `npm run demo:tamper` note; the audit log link in the teal strip is now there for everyone.

## The rule

A card is **data**, its inputs only, in one table (`CARD_INPUTS` in `src/server/demo-cards.ts`, checked by `demoCardSchema`): the customer, the item, the quantity, the term, the down payment, the quote day, the signing day, the rents to pay, the exit mode and the reported condition, and the day the judges look (`clock`). The outputs are whatever `createQuote`, `createApplication`, `signContract`, `payInvoice` and `previewExit` return; the runner never knows a card's numbers (AGENTS.md rule 7). Every write goes through those services, so through `withAudit`, and the audit log shows the run.

| Card               | Run                                     | Inputs                                           | Clock      | Actor   | Lands on                                                     |

Worked example, card 8 on a fresh database: the run answers five steps, `quote_created { monthlyNetCents: 10730, priceListVersion: 1 }`, `application_decided { decision: approved }`, `contract_signed`, `rents_paid { count: 7, grossCents: 94532 }` (2 × 13 466 + 5 × 13 520) and `exit_previewed { monthsPaid: 7, buyTotalCents: 330675, returnTotalCents: 75945 }`, sets the clock to 5 June 2027 and the actor to Aino, and lands on `/contracts/<id>`. Clicked after card 1, it reuses card 1's contract (`contract_reused`). Clicked again, it is refused (D70).

Steps and refusals are codes with params; the page writes them from `demo.step.<code>` and `demo.run.<code>` in the visitor's language, with `…Cents` as euros and days as dates (`src/app/[locale]/demo/card-steps.ts`).

## Decisions

- **D70** a second click is refused with `card_already_run` and links the earlier records; card 8 builds on card 1.
- **D71** the run sets the demo clock to the card's look day and the actor to the card's customer, on a run and on a refusal.
- **D72** card 2 signs on the second day and lands on the contract.
- Uses D17 (the actor cookie), D44 (tests own their `beforeEach`), and the demo clock of `docs/features/catalogue.md`.

## Pure functions

None: this slice has no domain logic (it only drives the services). The server functions:

- `runDemoCard(db, cardId) → { ok: true, run: { cardId, today, actor, steps: [{ code, params, href? }], landing } } | { ok: false, reason: card_already_run | card_step_refused, today, actor, landing | null }`.
- `afterReturn(db, card) → DemoStep[]`: the extension point for cards 9 and 10 (see open questions).
- `demoClockCookieHeader(asOf | null) → string`: the one writer of the demo clock cookie, used by `POST /api/demo/clock` and the card route.
- Page helpers: `codedMessage(prefix, { code, params }, t, locale)` and `cardInputs(card, names, t, locale)`.

## Files

- `src/server/demo-cards-schemas.ts`: the card id, the card table's schema, the step and the run (Zod).
- `src/server/demo-cards.ts`: the card table and the runner.
- `src/app/api/demo/cards/[id]/run/route.ts`: `POST /api/demo/cards/{id}/run`; its row is in `src/server/routes.ts` and `docs/openapi.json`.
- `src/server/demo-clock.ts`: `demoClockCookieHeader`; `src/app/api/demo/clock/route.ts` uses it.
- `src/app/[locale]/demo/page.tsx`, `card-list.tsx`, `card-run-form.tsx` (client), `card-steps.ts`.
- `src/components/site-header.tsx`: the audit log link for everyone.
- `src/i18n/messages/{en,fi,sv,et}.json`: `demo.tools.*`, `demo.run.*`, `demo.step.*`, `demo.input.*`, `demo.audit.*`.

## Tests that pin the numbers

- `src/server/demo-cards.test.ts`: one test per card on a test database (the records match the numbers `src/server/scenarios/` pins, and the landing page), card 8 after card 1, the repeat-run refusal writing nothing, all ten cards in one database with the audit chain intact, and a refused step.
- `src/app/api/demo/cards/[id]/run/route.test.ts`: the route sets both cookies, answers 409 `CARD_ALREADY_RUN` with the earlier page, and 400 for a card that does not exist.
- `src/app/[locale]/demo/card-steps.test.ts`: every step and refusal and every card's inputs line written in all four languages with no placeholder left.
- `src/server/demo-clock.test.ts`: the cookie header.

## Open questions

- **Cards 9 and 10 stop at the asset page.** `ebike-007` and `ebike-008` are already `returned` in the data pack, and the assessment, re-pricing and matchmaking are the `feat/second-life` slice, not on `main` yet. When it merges, its `assessAsset` plugs into `afterReturn(db, card)` in `src/server/demo-cards.ts`: card 9 assesses `ebike-007` (fair, 18 400 km), re-prices it and ranks `wait-02` and `wait-13`, landing on the second-life page; card 10 makes `ebike-008` available and runs card 1's path for its third life, landing on the passport. Each needs its inputs in the card table (the assessment's condition and usage) and a step code with its messages.
- The landing pages have no anchors (the exit block, the invoice table), since those components belong to other slices; the judge scrolls.
- A run of card 3 or 4 dated before card 1 (Sep 2026, Jan 2026) writes audit rows whose `created_at` is the real time; the audit log orders by row, not by the card's day.
