# Demo script: the pitch run (10 to 12 minutes)

The run we show the judges, one presenter at the keyboard. It clicks through the product; the organiser's "15-minute tour" in the [README](../README.md) is the other walk, through the code, and stays as it is. The numbers below come from the README "Status" table and the feature pages; a test pins every one of them, so if one differs on the day, the database is not fresh.

## Before you start (not on the clock)

```bash
npm ci
npm run db:reset     # a fresh database: every Run button writes its card once (D70)
npm run dev          # http://localhost:3000
```

Open `http://localhost:3000/en/demo` in a window about 1 280 px wide, with a second tab on `/en/audit`. Nobody is picked in "Continue as"; each Run button sets the actor and the demo clock itself (D71).

## 0:00 to 1:00, what it is

The landing page (`/en`): one e-bike, laptop or farm machine, three lives. Click into the catalogue: today's price per model, from the price list live on the demo clock's day. Then open the demo page from the teal strip.

- Point at: the **demo clock** on the demo page. Every date the product uses comes from it (one `todayIso()` per request); it is our time machine for cards 2, 3, 4 and 8.

## 1:00 to 8:30, the ten cards in order

Click **Run** on each card; the page lands where the judges compare the numbers. Say the one number, then go back to the demo page.

| Time | Card               | Lands on                                         | The one number to point at                                                                                                  |
| ---- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1:00 | 1 Happy path       | the contract (`/en/contracts/<id>`)              | **10 730** net a month (band B, factor 0.027584); invoices 13 466, 13 466, then **13 520** in January at 26 % VAT           |
| 2:00 | 2 The price lock   | the contract, signed on 6 Nov                    | the rent stays **9 627** from the 5 Nov quote although list 2 says 8 857 today                                              |
| 2:45 | 3 Tax is not price | the contract's invoices, clock 2027-01-01        | December gross **8 731**, January **8 766**: the net 6 957 never moves, the VAT follows the invoice date                    |
| 3:30 | 4 Calendar traps   | the contract, signed on 31 Jan 2026              | due **28 Feb 2026** and **29 Feb 2028**, ends 30 Jan 2029                                                                   |
| 4:00 | 5 Too young        | the application                                  | **rejected, too young**: Mikko turns 18 on 10 Mar 2027                                                                      |
| 4:30 | 6 Who can sign?    | the application, awaiting the signatory          | 4 × `ebike-004`: band C, **58 993** a month (one bike alone: band B, 15 144); only the named signatory's link signs (D46)   |
| 5:30 | 7 Big ticket       | the application, manual review                   | `farm-002`, 20 000 € down: 272 037.5 → **272 038** a month, one rounding; PEP sends it to a person                          |
| 6:15 | 8 Early exit       | card 1's contract and its exit block, 2027-06-05 | 7 rents paid; **buy 330 675**, return 75 945, the D14 balance line by line (the market value by months since lease, D31)    |
| 7:00 | 9 Second life      | see the note below                               | `ebike-007` back fair: no refurbishment beyond the battery and inspection (39 500), **`wait-02` at 8 710** a month for 12 m |
| 7:45 | 10 Third life      | the passport (`/en/assets/ebike-008/passport`)   | three lives, relisted at 37 101, leased again at 1 359 a month, **58 kg** CO₂ saved                                         |

**Cards 9 and 10, on the day.** On `main` at the time of writing, the Run buttons for 9 and 10 land on `/en/assets/ebike-007` and on the passport with the returned status only; the wave 3 hardening PR connects them to the assessment ([the wave 3 review](reviews/wave-3.md), finding 2). Once it is merged, card 9 lands on `/en/assets/ebike-007/second-life` (the options, the waiting list with each verdict, `wait-02` first and `wait-13` second because it needs 12 000 more work) and card 10 on the passport with the third life. Before it is merged, show them by hand: pick "Admin", open `/en/assets/ebike-007/second-life` and click "Assess and relist".

For card 6, if there is time: open the decision page's demo outbox, follow the signing link and sign as the named signatory; the coordinator who applied cannot sign.

## 8:30 to 10:00, the audit chain

Switch to the `/en/audit` tab and reload: every change the run made is a row, with its actor, and the badge says the chain is **intact** with the head hash. In a terminal:

```bash
npm run demo:tamper
```

Reload: the badge names the first broken row. That is tamper-evident, not tamper-proof ([audit-chain.md](features/audit-chain.md)). `npm run db:reset` restores it after the demo.

## 10:00 to 11:00, language and phone

- Switch the header to **suomi** (or **svenska**) on card 1's contract: the same numbers, the dates and euros in the local format, and every refusal and reason from the message files (the product returns codes, never sentences).
- Narrow the window to about **375 px** (or the browser's phone view): the catalogue, the contract and the demo page stack in one column, the header becomes the menu.

## 11:00 to 12:00, close

What is smart: one rounding, half up, in one function; the price locked and the tax not; the D14 early exit line by line; the second-life price and the waiting list ranked by rules, with the reason for every place. No AI anywhere in the product. The decisions are in [decisions.md](decisions.md), the open readings in [mentor-questions.md](mentor-questions.md).

## If something goes wrong

- A Run button answers "already run": the database is not fresh. The button links the earlier records, which still show the numbers; or `npm run db:reset` and reload.
- The clock is on the wrong day: set it on the demo page, or run the card again after a reset.
